# Why this exists:

  This is an univeristy assignment to just simply create quick-sort

## What did I do/learn?

Since I already knew quick-sort I used the assignment to:

- Got a better understanding of [swapping](https://github.com/MintzyG/DevMonoRepo/tree/master/Learning/C/Swap) methods
- Usage of `ifdef` for debugging
- Bash scripting for automation
- Started to get a code base going
- Visualized a sort just like those youtube videos :)
