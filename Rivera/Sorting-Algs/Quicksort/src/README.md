## Why this exists:
    
- Second university assignment from `Programming-2` class of 2023-2 (UENF)

## What did it ask/What did I do?

- Code Quick-Sort First or Last recursively
- Show every step the array took to become sorted

## What did I do/learn?

Since I already knew quick-sort I used the assignment to:

- Got a better understanding of [swapping](https://github.com/MintzyG/DevMonoRepo/tree/master/Learning/C/Swap) methods
- Usage of `ifdef` and the pre-processor for debugging
- Bash scripting for automation
- Started to get a code base going
- Visualized a sort just like those youtube videos :)
- Learned how to pass unitialized pointers/structs to functions for initializations
- Used ioctl to fit my visualization in any terminal sized in any way

## What do I think of this after?

This is a much better suited assignment for first assignment in a class where most students barely coded before and even less used C.

As a follow-up to the first exercise this is weird
