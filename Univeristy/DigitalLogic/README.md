## Why this exists:
    
- Digital Logic assignment to make a circuit for some exercicse on the book

## What did it ask/What did I do?

- Create the circuit from some exercise on the book

## What did I do/learn?

This was a group exercise and I thought me and my group could make something a little cooler, so we did.
We chose a 3x3 grid of Conway's Game of Life as our "Book exercise" even tho it wasn't in the book hehe.

Circuit explanation [here](https://github.com/MintzyG/MyMonoRepo/blob/master/Univeristy/DigitalLogic/src/README.md).

- Used simplification techniques like Karnaugh maps and Mathmatical Logic
- Learned how to create a inputs to binary circuit
- Learned how adders work
- Learned how flipflops work
- Saw how a difference in simple interpretation of rules changes a circuit
- Learned how to use Proteus

## What do I think of this after?

Very cool assignment, had fun making it, and learning through it.
