## Why this exists:

- Third university assignment from `Programming-2` class of 2023-2 (UENF)

## What did it want us to do?

- Generate N random points
- Create a non-intersecting solid with these points
- calculate the area of the given solid

## What do I think of this after?

- Cool project to visualize via code, maybe I'll do it with OpenGL in the future!
