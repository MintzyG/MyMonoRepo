# To start please enable nix-command in your nix.conf or configuration.nix
# A nix file can only hold a single expression
# that may be:
#
# 1: a number:
# 42
#
# 2: a string:
# "Hello"
#
# 3: a boolean
# true
# false
#
# 4: lists:
# where list elements are space separated
# [ 1 2 3 ];
#
# 5: atribute sets
# where atribute sets work very similar to json
# {
#   name = "value";
# }
#
# 6: let bindings:
# you can look at let bindings as a way to create variables
# 
# let
#   myNumber = 42
# in
#   myNumber
#
# this can be viewed like the following
#
# let
#   These_bindings = 1;
#   That_exist_here = 2;
#   exist_in_'in' = 3;
#   we_can_have_as_many_bindings_as_we_want = 4;
# in
#   here is where you can use your bindings
#   we can do stuff like arithmetic with them
#   These_bindings + That_exist_here
#   look at letBindings.nix for examples
#
# Try evaluating the files in this folder with 
"nix eval --file ./NAME.nix"
